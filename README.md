Adds two new parameter types called Admin String Parameter and 
Admin Boolean Parameter, which are visible only to users with 
admin permissions. Additionally, parameters can be set just hidden 
from non-admin users on UI.

These parameter types are intended to prevent normal users from 
seeing and adjusting these parameter values, while the admin user 
can see them on the build screen. They should not be considered as a 
secret parameter.
